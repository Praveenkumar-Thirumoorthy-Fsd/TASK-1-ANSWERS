1.Difference between http1.1 vs http2
 HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other so if one resource cannot be       loaded it blocks all the other resources behind it
 HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams od data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
